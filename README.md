JNI_DEMO_JAVA_TO_RUST

The above demo project illustrates how to setup a basic flow from Java to Rust via a simple JNI bridge with the help of shared object files(.so file). This is very useful when we need to combine usecases where we have both orchestration and performance needs, where appropriate programming languages such as Java and Rust respectively in this case, can be used to obtain the best results.
